    "Now let's have a glimpse of some advanced concepts in Python, though we will delay most of the discussions in later lectures. The topic we want to have a mild introduction on is called 'Python method'. Strictly speaking, a **method** is a piece of code that is called by name that is associated with an object. For the most part, every object in Python has its own associated methods. For example, strings have associated methods that can help turn them into upper case, lower case, or proper case etc. In addition, since strings can also be split and counted, there are methods built to split the characters into different parts or to count the number of string characters. In a similar fashion, other types of objects have their own associated methods too. Here let's only focus on strings. For example, the associated methods include upper(), lower(), and split() etc.. In particular, the center() method allows you to place your string 'centered' between a provided string with a certain length. The expandtabs() will expand tab notations \"\\t\" into spaces:"

    "Speaking of strings, it's inevitable to talk about a very important concept called 'classes', which is closely related to 'methods' since Python is an object-oriented-programming (OOP) language.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we need to understand how OOP works. First, **Python objects** are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program are represented by objects or by relations between objects. Every object has an identity, a type and a value. Thus a string is an object. A number, say 45, is an object. You will see other types of more advanced objects in the future (say lists, dictionaries, sets, functions, modules etc.). An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., does it have a length?) and also defines the possible values for objects of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has a type, but the type can be user-defined. A **Python class** is essentially a mechanism Python gives us to create new user-defined types from Python codes. In this sense, a class and a type is extremely similar, except that people often use the class construct in a more general setting to create user-defined types. We will see more concepts like these in the lecture specifically dedicated to studying OOP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not unlike the ambiguity between \"class\" and \"type\", A **Python instance** is synonymous to \"object\". Think of it this way: objects are instances of types. So,saying \"42 is an instance of the type int\" is equivalent to saying \"42 is an int object\". Many lazy programmers usually use \"instance\" and \"object\" interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most respects, a method (associated with its object) is identical to a function except for two key differences. First, it is implicitly passed for the object for which it was called. Second, it is able to operate on data that is contained within the class. We often say that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data."

    "Python can also handle more advanced number types. In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a 'radix', or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen. Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers. As each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). Each digit is referred to as a bit. In contrast, a binary number is a number expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which represents numeric values using two different symbols. Python can handle both types of data."
