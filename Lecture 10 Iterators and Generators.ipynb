    "We study generators first. Generators are essentially a special type of function. They are very similar to normal functions, whereas generators allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off. A generator will allow us to generate a sequence of values over time. The main difference in syntax will be the use of a 'yield' statement instead of a 'return' statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in most aspects, a generator will appear very similar to a conventional function. The main difference is when a generator is compiled, they become an object that support something called an **iteration protocol**. That means when they are called in your code they don't actually return a value and then exit, the generators will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation. Put another way, while a 'return' statement terminates a function entirely, a 'yield' statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls. If a function contains at least one 'yield' statement (it may contain other 'yield' or 'return' statements), it becomes a generator function. From a processsing efficiency perspective, generators allow us to generate as we go along, instead of holding everything in memory.\n",

    "Now let's discuss **iterators**, which are objects that can be iterated upon. Iterators are actually very commonplace in Python. They are often elegantly implemented within for loops, comprehensions, generators etc. but hidden in plain sight. Technically speaking, Python iterator object must implement two special methods, '\\__iter\\__()' and '\\__next\\__()', collectively called the iterator protocol. An object is called **iterable** if we can get an iterator from it. Most of built-in containers in Python like: list, tuple, string etc. are iterables. The iter() function (which in turn calls the '\\__iter\\__()' method) returns an iterator from them. However, note that iterables are not necessarily iterator objects. "
