    "Now we can finally talk about decorators. Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions. By definition, a **decorator** is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. In mathematics and computer science, a **high-order** function is a function that does at least one of the following: 1) it takes one or more functions as arguments, and 2) it returns a function as its result. Decorators are often used in web development. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions and methods are **callables** as they can be called. In fact, any object which implements the special method \\__call\\__() is termed callable. So, in the most basic sense, a decorator is a callable that returns a callable. Basically, a decorator takes in a function, adds some functionality and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how to create decorators, we will first write a set of normal codes for passing functions. Then we will invoke the decorators to make the existing code more simple. Below, we create a function called new_decorator() which takes any function as its argument. Inside this new_decorator() function, we define a wrapper() function in which it executes the argument of the new_decorator() function. We also create another function g() that later needs a decorator. "
