    "We now study errors handling in Python. Firstly, we need to understand what an error or an exception is respectively. A syntax error is truly an error. However, an exception is a contextual error which may occur even if you have completely correct syntax but the context is not appropriate. To handle errors and exceptions, the 'try' and 'except' statements are often used. In addition, the 'finally' keyword allows us to place code that will always be run even if there are exceptions. The examples in this module will make these concepts clear. "
